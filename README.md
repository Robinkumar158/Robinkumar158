# 🎬 IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on IMDB movie reviews using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative** based on their textual content.

## 📌 Objective

To build a model that can automatically analyze movie reviews and determine the **sentiment** (positive/negative) expressed in the text.

### 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of two columns:

- `text`: The actual movie review written by a user.
- `sentiment`: The label or output — typically `positive` or `negative`.

#### Example:

| text                                           | sentiment |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| "An amazing movie with brilliant acting!"      | positive  |
| "Terribly slow and boring. Not recommended."   | negative  |

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Vectorization (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer)
- Classification models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Transformers (e.g., BERT)
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Word clouds and confusion matrix visualizations

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Sentiment analysis helps in understanding audience reactions at scale.
- Words like “great,” “amazing,” “fantastic” often indicate positive sentiment.
- Words like “worst,” “boring,” “waste” are common in negative reviews.

## ✅ Outcome

A machine learning pipeline that can accurately classify IMDB reviews based on sentiment. This project demonstrates how NLP can be applied to real-world text data for opinion mining and social media analysis.
